Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Adinda Sarianti, you can simply call me Adinda. I hold a degree in Mathematics with a minor in Statistics. My interest in Statistics has driven me to further explore the world of data analysis and career opportunities in this field.

In college, I had the opportunity to study various topics related to data, such as statistical analysis, data visualization, and the application of machine learning to uncover patterns and make predictions.

Currently, I'm focusing on continuously learning and honing the skills needed to become a Data Analyst. My goal is to use these skills in a job where I can turn data into useful insights.

These repositories contain the projects I've worked on as part of my journey to build a career in the field of data.
